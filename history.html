        <h2>Key Milestones in VCS History</h2>
        <p>Version Control Systems have evolved significantly over the years. Here are some key milestones:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RCS (Revision Control System)</strong>: Introduced in the 1980s, this was one of the first systems to track file revisions.</li>
            <li><strong>CVS (Concurrent Versions System)</strong>: Developed in the early 1990s, CVS enabled multiple developers to work concurrently on a codebase.</li>
            <li><strong>Subversion (SVN)</strong>: Launched in 2000, Subversion improved on CVS with better branching and merging capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Git</strong>: Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, Git revolutionized version control with its distributed model and powerful branching/merging features.</li>
            <li><strong>Mercurial</strong>: Another distributed VCS, Mercurial is known for its simplicity and ease of use, similar to Git.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Distributed VCS Changed the Game</h2>
        <p>Distributed version control systems (like Git and Mercurial) allowed developers to have full copies of the repository locally. This enables faster operations, better branching/merging workflows, and decentralization of control, which was a game-changer for collaborative development.</p>
