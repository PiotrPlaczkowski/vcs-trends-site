        <h2>Modern Trends in Version Control</h2>
        <p>As VCS have evolved, so have the workflows and tools that accompany them. Here are some major modern trends:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pull Requests (PRs)</strong>: Pull requests allow contributors to propose changes to the codebase, which can be reviewed and discussed before being merged.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation & CI/CD</strong>: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate testing and deployment, improving code quality and speeding up development.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Coding</strong>: Platforms like GitHub and GitLab foster social coding by allowing developers to collaborate easily, track issues, and even contribute to open-source projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Hosting Platforms</strong>: GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket have become central hubs for code hosting, offering powerful collaboration features and integrations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why These Trends Matter</h2>
        <p>These modern practices have transformed the software development landscape, making collaboration easier, faster, and more transparent. Automated workflows, like CI/CD, reduce human error, while platforms like GitHub facilitate open-source contributions and continuous code improvement.</p>
